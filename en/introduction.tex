Items marked with $\ast$ in each chapter are undergraduate review; in class we will only give a brief recap.
Sections marked with $\dagger$ contain detailed discussions and derivations. We will generally skip these; please read them if you have time. $\clubsuit$ indicates hints for calculations.
Items marked with $\ddagger$ are somewhat tangential to the main topic or provide additional material.
